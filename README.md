# AoC2022
My solutions for Advent of Code 2022

Goals:
* Do it in Rust (again)
* Enjoy it
* Finish all days by the 25th (hopefully, by all means not a sure thing) for the third year in a row
* Reasonably readable code
* No peeking in the reddit thread

Non goals:
* Being super fast
* Optimal solutions, if I get occassionally only find a solution that converges in 60 minutes or less that is fine
